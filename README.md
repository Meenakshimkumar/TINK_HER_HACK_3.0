### Project Description
This Telegram bot helps users identify and manage inactive groups. When enabled in a group, it monitors activity and lists inactive groups to the user. The user can then choose to keep or delete the group, with guided instructions for deletion.

### The Problem statement
Many users are part of multiple Telegram groups that become inactive over time, cluttering their chats. Manually identifying and leaving such groups is time-consuming.

### The Solution
